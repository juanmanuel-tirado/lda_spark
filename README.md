# lda_spark
Exercises to use LDA with spark.

The available code contains a template to start with. The project currently has two datasets:
* Enron spam
* Gutenberg most downloaded books

The cleaning pipeline has to be defined for every dataset, and then LDA can be executed and resulting topics
explored.
